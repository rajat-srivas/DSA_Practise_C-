Is a Binary Tree => i.e max 2 children of each node
Special Properties 
Left subtree nodes < root node
Right subtrr nodes > root node
Left & right subtree are also BST and have no duplicates

Inorder traversal of BST returns a sorted sequence

Search => BST are used to make search more efficient
Search is similar to Binary Search of array
So we first compare with root, if search term is less then we search in left subtree else right subtree because of the special property of the BST

In worst case search snereio the time complexity = O(height of tree) as we look for item per level

Skewed trees=tree with nodes only on one side i.e either no left nodes or no right nodes 

Important => Delete a node BST 
Three case 
	Node to delete is
		No Child => delete a node and return null to parent
		One Child => delete node and replace node with child node
		Two Child => replace with inorder successor and delete the node for inorder successor => inorder successor can have max 0 or 1 children
now to find inordersuccessor => go to right subtree and find left most node
